# Gif Retriever 

### Description
A dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice. 

# Motivation
For those who want to easily search for and save favorite gifs

### Results
Uses asynchronous Ajax requests to the GIPHY API. Individual gifs can be favorited and saved or removed from local storage using jQuery, and are retrieved on page reload. Gifs change from static to animated state on click event.

### Future Improvements
- [ ] Prevent users from favoriting the same gif
